Lets check below some selectors which are valid to use:

- `pre` - Copy button added all the `pre` tags.

Yes, We can change the default strings of the button text, button copied text and the title of the button too.

= Can I change the copy button position?

Yes, By default the button is added within the selector. But, We can change it outside the selector.

= Can I change the selector with filter? =

Yes, We can use the `copy_the_code_localize_vars` selector to change the currently stored selector.

E.g.

<pre>
add_filter( 'copy_the_code_localize_vars', 'my_slug_copy_the_code_localize_vars' );
function my_slug_copy_the_code_localize_vars( $defaults )
{
	// `single class is added to the `<body>` tag for the single page, post etc.
	$defaults['selector'] = 'body.single pre';

	return $defaults;	
}
</pre>

= Is plugin compatible for all the themes? =

Yes, We have added `!important` for the Copy button to keep the button style same for each theme. We have tested below themes.
