=== Copy Anything to Clipboard: the #1 WordPress Copy to Clipboard plugin

Add a copy button anywhere and simply copy it into the clipboard (ðŸ“‹).

You can copy to clipboard: code snippets, special symbols, discount codes, or anything which you want.

By default, the copy button is added to the `<pre>` tag. You can easily change the `pre` tag selector with any other selector. You can read more [about selector](https://maheshwaghmare.com/doc/copy-anything-to-clipboard/#what-is-the-selector).

Just use the shortcode as:

<pre>
[copy]hello world[/copy]
</pre>

Above shortcode show the link with text "Copy" and on click on that link the text "hello world" copied into the clipboard.

We see the text "Copied" after clicking on the link which indicate user something is copied to clipboard.

See short video:

If you want to show the button instead of link then use:
[copy tag="button"]hello world[/copy]

Yes, We can use the `copy_the_code_localize_vars` selector to change the currently stored selector.

E.g.

<pre>
add_filter( 'copy_the_code_localize_vars', 'my_slug_copy_the_code_localize_vars' );
function my_slug_copy_the_code_localize_vars( $defaults )
{
	// `single class is added to the `<body>` tag for the single page, post etc.
	$defaults['selector'] = 'body.single pre';

	return $defaults;	
}
</pre>

= Is plugin compatible for all the themes? =
